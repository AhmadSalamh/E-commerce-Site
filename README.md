    React and Strapi Application
    This project is a full-stack web application built with React and Strapi. It combines the frontend power of React with the backend capabilities of Strapi to create a robust and dynamic web solution

## Project Description: 
    ```
    The React and Strapi application provides a user-friendly interface for managing and displaying various types of content. It leverages React's component-based architecture to create a responsive and interactive frontend, while Strapi serves as the headless CMS (Content Management System) to handle data storage, retrieval, and content management.

## Features

1. Content Management: With Strapi's flexible content types, you can easily define and manage your application's data structures. Create custom content types, add fields, and organize your content according to your specific requirements.

2. User Authentication and Permissions: Utilizing Strapi's users and permissions plugin, you can implement secure user authentication and manage user roles and permissions. Control access to different parts of the application based on user roles.
